Why should i care about memory alignment? What is it about anyways? Does it have
to do with the size of my variables? instruction sizes? What about the CPU and GPU?
Why is there a difference with taking care of it? Is it about performance or is
it important to do these? Is this something that is done but isn't explicit
(in reference to higher-level languages like python)?
