# SAGE: Sage Ain't a Game Engine

Sage is our first attempt at building a real-time rendering engine

This project is both a learning-attempt as well as open-documentation with the
intent to showcase how such a rendering engine is made. 

We wanted to make this not only for ourselves but to help others in climbing the
same mountain of computer graphics and graphics programming.

Sage grew out of the desire to make a game - which became a desire to make a 
game engine to make that game - which finally evolved into focusing on real-time
rendering.
